    <p>NEW YORK â€” In case they had any doubts, New Yorkers now have some hard evidence that they live in the greatest city on Earth. New York City was named the world's best city in the 2019 Time Out Index, which the global culture magazine published this week.</p>
    <p>Time Out surveyed more than 30,000 people across 48 cities to confirm what dwellers of the five boroughs have always known. The ranking is also based on the views of Time Out's local editors and city experts.</p>
